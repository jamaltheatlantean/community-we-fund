## A COMMUNITY FUNDING CONTRACT
I created this contract as one(1) of six(6) projects to help boost close community/organizational funding, for the purpose of granting loans to it's members.

One of it's purpose is to be simple, transparent and easy to use.

Community members are assigned the role of Benefactor, and to ensure that everyone is ready to commit to funding as a community they are required to pay a registration
fee that gets stored in the contract.
The community can agree upon an agreed interval for funding(weekly/monthly/yearly) and if a member of the community was in need of funding
they will simply make a request to have a certain amount of funds transferred from the community funds to them. If more than half of the 
community approves of the individuals reason then they get the funds transferred to them by calling the execute function hardcoded.
